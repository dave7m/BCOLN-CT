# 🎰 UZH Uniswap V3 Lottery dApp

A decentralized lottery application built with Solidity smart contracts, a Next.js frontend (App Router), and Ethereum-based deployment (Hardhat). This project demonstrates transparency, randomness, and trust through verifiable lottery draws and automated prize distribution.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (`npm install -g yarn`)

---

### 🚀 Install Dependencies

1. Run this from the root of the project:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install dependencies for:
- Root (Hardhat + Solidity)
- `frontend/` workspace (React, Next.js, etc.)

2. Start Local Node and Deploy Contracts

   Step 1: Start the Hardhat Local Node
   In Terminal #1, run:
```bash
yarn hardhat node
```
   Step 2: Deploy Contracts
   In Terminal #2, run the following commands:
```bash
# Deploy base contracts
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

# Deploy example contract (optional)
yarn hardhat run deploy/deployExample.ts
```

Then open your browser at: http://localhost:3000

## 🎮 Usage

### 🔧 Compile Contracts

```bash
yarn compile
```

### 🧹 Clean Artifacts

```bash
yarn clean
```

### 🚀 Deploy Locally (testnet / localhost)

For deploying contracts to a blockchain, we need to use the private_key of an account.
Please create a `env.local` file, where you can store your private keys. Do not expose
them outside of this. Also, you must give the RPC_URL a blockchain.
Your `env.local` file should then look like this:

```dotenv
TEST_NET_PRIVATE_KEY='0x...'
TEST_NET=http://127.0.0.1:7545
```

```bash
yarn deploy:local
```

_(Customize your Hardhat networks in `hardhat.config.js`)_

Once you have deployed a contract, you can interact with it:
```js
const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("HelloWorldContract", "0x...");
await contract.getMessage();
```

---

### 🧪 Run Tests

Coming soon: `yarn test`

---

### 🧼 Lint the Codebase

```bash
yarn lint
```

This runs:
- `next lint` in the `frontend/` workspace
- `solhint` on Solidity contracts

### 💅 Format All Files

```bash
yarn format
```

Runs Prettier across the whole monorepo.

---

### 🖥️ Run the Frontend

From the root:

```bash
yarn workspace frontend dev
```

Then open your browser at:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
